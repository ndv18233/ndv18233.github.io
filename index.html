	<p><span style="color: white">Derek Sanderson Jeter was born June 26, 1974 in Pequannock Township, New Jersey to Sanderson and Dorothy Jeter. His father was a collegiate baseball player at Fisk University, where he played shortstop. Not only did Derek share his father's passion for the game, but he followed in his footsteps to become a top high school prospect at the shortstop position in the early 1990s. Jeter attended Kalamazoo Central High School in Michigan where he was a three sport athlete. He ran cross country in the fall, played basketball in the winter, and of course, played baseball in the spring. Jeter starred, garnering national attention en route to being named the 1992 Gatorade High School Player of the Year and USA Today's High School Player of the Year.</p>
	<p><span style="color: white">Derek was drafted sixth overall by the New York Yankees straight out of high school in 1992 before making his debut with the team in 1995. During his 20-year career, Jeter won 5 World Series and became the Yankees all-time leader in numerous statistical categories including hits. He was selected to 14 American League All-Star teams and was named Most Valuable Player of the Major League All-Star Game in 2000. In 2003, Jeter was named the captain of the Yankees, becoming only the eleventh player to earn that title in the team's century-plus existence. Thus, Jeter was given his simple but iconic nickname: The Captain. </span></p>
	<p><span style="color: white">Prior to the start of the 2014 season, Derek announced that he would be retiring at season's end. He then went on to embark on a retirement tour for the ages. In Jeter's final game in each away ballpark, he was honored with gifts and tributes from the opposing teams including donations to his charity. Derek's 2014 campaign was not just a nolstalgia act though. He continued to break not only Yankee franchise records, but Major League records as well. Jeter played his final home game in Yankee Stadium on September 25, 2014. In front of a sellout crowd, he reaffirmed his already cemented status as one of the most clutch performers in sports history. With the game tied in the bottom of the ninth inning, Jeter came to the plate and delivered a game-winning walkoff single. It was the perfect sendoff for one of the greatest players and winners that the sport of baseball has ever seen.</p>
